In airport security there are two lines: one for TSA pre-check and one for all other passengers.  TSA pre-check passengers go through security first.  Every time a pre-check passenger is taken through security, another one arrives in the pre-check line.  The other passengers wait and never get to go through security.  This is an example of:

<b>Correct!</b> Since pre-check passengers are always given priority and there is always at least one pre-check passenger in line, regular passengers are never given the opportunity to move through the line.

<b>Incorrect.</b> Since pre-check passengers are always going through security, only one type of passenger is recieving service. An example of <b>Deadlock</b> in this case would be two unbelievably nice passengers, both a pre-check and regular. The pre-check sees a regular in line and offers for them to go first. Appreciative of the offer, the regular insists the pre-check go first, which the pre-check brushes off and again offers the regular go through security first. This back-and-forth exchange continues indefinitely.
