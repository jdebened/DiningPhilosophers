Since we now understand the Dining Philosophers Problem (in both theoretical and practical contexts) and its solutions, it is now your turn to solve the problem. You can use one of the two common solutions or try one of your own. Below you will find some JavaScript code which simulates the Dining Philosophers Problem along with some helpful code to start you off on the right path. When you submit your test code, you will receive a message indicating if you were successful or not. If you were not, do not be discouraged. Give it another try. You will receive error messages that should guide you to a correct solution.

If you are not too confident in your JavaScript abilities, please refer to the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">W3 Schools</a> tutorials to brush up on the syntax.
