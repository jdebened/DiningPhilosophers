<h2>Real Life xample&nbsp;</h2>

<p>ND has the best football program in the whole country<img alt="wink" height="23" src="http://www.html.am/html-editors/ckeditor/ckeditor_4.4.1_full/plugins/smiley/images/wink_smile.png" title="wink" width="23" />, but something weird happens. There are 100 players on the team, but with only 50 helmets and jerseys available. Each player needs to put on a helmet and a jersey in order to play.</p>

<p>Why would it be bad:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There can be only 50 people at most play at the same time.</li>
	<li>Each someone plays for a lot of time, then others will have no chance to play.</li>
	<li>If someone enters without a helmet or jersey, he will be fined and given a penalty. :(</li>
	<li>Deadlocks happen if someone has only helmet or jersey.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Starvation happens if one could not get the equipments needed to play.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soultion:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We can set a rule that each player plays for a certain amount of time and then gives his gears to another person, and the rotation goes on.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If a player has only helmet, then he needs to pass this helmet on to someone who only has a jersey.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Every ND player should play hard and respectfully.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
