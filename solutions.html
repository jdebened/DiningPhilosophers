Now that we understand the Dining Philosophers Problem, we need to figure out a solution.
Our optimal solution will ensure that each philosopher has an equal time to eat and think.
Ideally, we would also want to maximize the amount of time each philosopher can spend on both tasks.
We also want to make sure no philosophers starve or wait too long to eat.

The Dining Philosophers Problem has two common solutions:
<p>
1. Resource Hierarchy
The resource hierarchy solution establishes are ordering to the chopsticks...
</p>
<p>
2. Arbitrator
Unlike the resource hierarchy solution, the arbitrator solution adds a new construct to the problem; a waiter...

Now it is your turn to try. Below you will find the philosophers ready to eat. There are a handful of variables you can manipulate to alter their behavior. See if you can solve the problem using either of the two methods above, or try your own method. There are more than two ways to solve this problem.
